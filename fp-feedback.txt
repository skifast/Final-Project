Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
	I would estimate my grade to be an 85-91. I do not think the workload distribution was fair.

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
	Maybe an A or A-? I attended nearly every lecture and many office hours, asking and answering plenty of in-class questions. I improved a lot on my over-scoping problem. I've done all corrections that have been made available so far. I still struggle to incorporate all conventions and best practices, which has made me lose points. I spend a lot of time going to lectures, watching them on canvas, and studying the slides. I was also fairly active on Discord. 

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
	I'd like feedback on the backend with some hints on how POST could have been implemented.

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
	Nope

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
	Sure! Named credit please
